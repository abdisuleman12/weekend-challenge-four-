<!-- For your weekend challenge, you will need to create an application that records employee records along with their salary. We also want to add the salaries up so we know how much we’re spending each month in salary. We will be using Angular, Node/Express, AJAX, and SQL. Any application logic can remain on the client side, but all data storage should be handled by the server and your database. Be sure to include all your CREATE TABLE queries in a database.sql file in your repo!

The application should first have an input form that collects:

The Employee's First Name

The Employee's Last Name

The Employee's Job Title

The Employee's Salary (Yearly)

The form should have a submit button that clears out the form and your employees database should store that information. Then, that information should be appended to the DOM so the user of the application can see the information they just entered.

Your logic should calculate all of the employee salaries and report back what the monthly cost of salaries is. -->
